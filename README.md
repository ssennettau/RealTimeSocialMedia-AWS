# Real-Time Social Media Sentiment Analysis with Serverless Generative AI

In this hands-on workshop, you'll dive into the world of real-time data processing by building a social media sentiment analysis pipeline on AWS. We'll explore how to leverage serverless architecture to handle data in real-time at minimal cost. The workshop will guide you through a rich use case combining traditional AI with the powerful capabilities of modern Generative AI and LLMs. By the end, you'll have a working knowledge of how to integrate these technologies into scalable, serverless applications that can analyze and respond to social media trends as they happen, or apply this knowledge to any other real-time use case.

No coding is required—just bring your laptop and an AWS account. Whether you're new to serverless or AI, we’ve got you covered. We’ll provide a high-level overview of the architecture and walk you through the steps to deploy and experiment with it yourself. This workshop is perfect for anyone looking to get hands-on experience with real-time data processing and AI on the cloud.
